# student-loan-fund
 A project for student loan relief


I'd like to set up an investment fund that people can contribute to in order to be set up as a recipient of the funds interest to pay off their student loans. 

The basic concept of this is, if everyone in the states or everyone that owed student loans paid x amount of money into the fund and we use the interest from that fund to pay off the highest interest and smallest loans first.....it would take us x amount of time to deliver x amount of relief to everyone. 

I just need the formula and I can build the project.

# student-loan-fund
 A project for student loan relief

## Concept

 An investment fund that people can contribute to in order to be set up as a recipient of the funds interest to pay off their student loans. 
 Each individuals contributions stay in the fund even after thier loan has been paid off so as the funds interest continues to compound over time. 

## Variables 

- number of individuals
- % of interest on each loan
- each loan term length
- loan amount 
- individuals debt-to-income ratio
- fund seed money (?)
- fund interest of return 
- fund rate of return (how often it compounds)

## Thoughts 

While I would prefer to help the individuals who need it most (low income & highest levels of debt) it makes the most sense for everyone to pay off the loans for those who owe the least and make the most as they can give more freely to the fund and we can pay off faster so as to benefit from re-distributing the interest from their  "permanently staked" funds to other individuals

It might be best to do this in co-horts. Maybe we focus on specific loans within specific states or borrowers of a certain age that owe a certain amount. With some research I've found that 75% of individuals owe the median amount of about 37k or less. Additionally, these 75% of indiviuals owe 63% of the debt. 

Ideally what i'd like to do is simply decide how this structure works, set up the fund and display all the data on the website so....user lands on homepage and that homepage will say x amount of people and x amount of funds to pay off. It will display the historical and projected preformance of the fund as well as how many people have contributed etc. There should be a small percentage of this that goes to whoever helps with the IP of this formula and maintains the site which should be quite substantatial with thin 10+ years even if it's only 1%. 

At a certian point, in 10, 20, or 30 years the fund will be worth more than the debt and we can start allocating excess towards scholarships/teachers or buying schools and making them free idk.

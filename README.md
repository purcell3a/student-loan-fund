 A project for student loan relief


I'd like to set up an investment fund that people can contribute to in order to be set up as a recipient of the funds interest to pay off their student loans. 

The basic concept of this is, if everyone in the states or everyone that owed student loans paid x amount of money into the fund and we use the interest from that fund to pay off the highest interest and smallest loans first.....it would take us x amount of time to deliver x amount of relief to everyone. 

The money people give to the fund would stay in the the fund even after their debt is paid off, this way the interest gained on the fund each year would grow and we would be able to help exponentially more people each year. 

I just need the formula and I can build the project.
